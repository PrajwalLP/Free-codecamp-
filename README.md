# Free-codecamp-
This is all the codes that i have written to get the challanges from free code camp
This is the journey of me from the beginning of my web development journey from knowing nothing to getting to know stuff from both frontend and backend of the web dev . 
So we do the free code camp problems everyday and I will try and upload all the codes that I have writtn in FCC[Free code camp] .
I will upload all the things i have done till now in one day then we progress on daily basis 
I will also use GIT to directly upload the code from the VS code so that it will be useful for learning GITHUB too .
Thank you for checking my solutions.
