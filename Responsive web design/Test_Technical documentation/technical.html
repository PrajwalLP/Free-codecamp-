            An assembly language is a type of low-level programming language
            that is intended to communicate directly with a computer’s hardware.
            Unlike machine language, which consists of binary and hexadecimal
            characters, assembly languages are designed to be readable by
            humans.

            Low-level programming languages such as assembly language are a
            necessary bridge between the underlying hardware of a computer and
            the higher-level programming languages

            language, it has since expanded significantly over time; as of 1997,
            C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in
